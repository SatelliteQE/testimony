What is Testimony?
``````````````````

Testimony is an approach to document test cases in the Python source code using
the function docstrings.

If your answer is ``yes`` to both the questions below, then ``Testimony`` is the
right tool for you.

1. Are you using python to automate your test cases?
2. Are you tired of managing your test cases in a test case management tool?
   
Don't worry.  Testimony can help you to use your Python automation framework as
a test case repository tool.

.. _advantages:

Advantages
``````````

Using Testimony brings lot of advantages to your project:

1. Avoid using a test case management tool to document test cases by leveraging
   function docstrings for the same.
2. Enforce standards for your test case docstrings.
3. Run with CI tools like Travis to validate your code after every check-in.
4. Save a lot of time from the conventional way of writing test cases using a
   test management tool.
5. Easily extract test case information using Testimony and port it to any test
   management tool.

.. _testcase_docstring_format:

Test Case Docstring format
``````````````````````````

Testimony allows you to easily configure ``Testimony tokens`` which are the
defined docstring items which will be used in test case parsing.

1. tokens - Allowed values to be used as docstring items in your tests.  Default
   tokens are ``assert``, ``bz``, ``feature``, ``setup``, ``status``, ``steps``,
   ``tags``, ``test`` and ``type``.
2. minimum-tokens - minimum set of tokens that are needed for each of your
   tests.  Default minimum tokens are ``assert``, ``feature`` and ``test``.

.. note::

  To help test case parsing, make sure that each test case docstring has the
  tokens prefixed with ``@`` and suffixed with ``:``.  Otherwise, you may see
  incorrect results.

.. _sample_testcase:

Sample Test Case
++++++++++++++++

A sample python test case with test case tokens is shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_login_1(self):
        """Check if a user is able to login with valid userid and password

        More description for the test.

        @feature: Login
        @setup: Navigate to abc.com
        @steps:
            1. Launch the url
            2. Log in with valid user credentials
        @assert: Log in successful
        @bz: 1234567
        @automated: false
        """

In the above example, as you may guess - `feature`, `setup`, `steps`, `assert`,
`bz`, `automated` are all tokens.

.. _how_it_works:

How it works?
`````````````

To understand how Testimony works, let's look at the ``help`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ testimony --help
      Usage: testimony [OPTIONS] REPORT [PATH]...

      Inspect and report on the Python test cases.

      Options:
      -j, --json             JSON output
      -n, --nocolor          Color output
      --tokens TEXT          Comma separated list of expected tokens
      --minimum-tokens TEXT  Comma separated list of minimum expected tokens
      --help                 Show this message and exit.

Testimony does the following to parse the test case docstrings:

1. It captures all `Python Test modules`_ in the path(s) provided by the
   ``PATH`` argument.

     - As the definition implies, ``PATH`` accepts more than one value.
     - If ``PATH`` is a directory, then the directory and its subdirectories
       will be inspected for test modules as well.

2. Inside each identified test module, it looks for `Python Test case
   functions`_
3. It then parses the function docstrings and extracts their tokens. Also, it
   creates namespaces for ``module`` and ``class`` level docstrings which will
   then be  reused in the children tests.  For example, if a module has a
   token called ``feature``, then all tests in that module will inherit it by
   default. But the individual tests can choose to override this value by
   defining their own. The token lookup will happen in the following order and
   it will stop on the very first match::

      1. function level
      2. class level
      3. module level

.. _installation:

Installation
````````````

You can install Testimony from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/testimony>`_
using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install testimony

Usage Examples
``````````````

.. note::

  For easy understanding of Testimony, this repository is already included with
  a sample python test module ``tests/test_sample.py``.  This module contains
  different test case format examples.  The sample commands used below also use
  this data.

.. _help_command:

help command
++++++++++++

See how_it_works_ section


.. _print_command:

print command
+++++++++++++

Prints a nice summary of all captured tests with the parsed tokens for each
test.  Also it prints non-recognized tokens.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ testimony print tests | head -n 27

    tests/test_sample.py
    ====================

    test_positive_login_1
    ---------------------

    Assert:
     Login is successful

    Setup:
     Setup Testsample1

    Steps:
     1. Login to the application with valid credentials

    Tags:
     t1, t2, t3

    Test:
     Login with right credentials

    Unexpected tokens:
      Bug: 123456
      Feture: Login - Positive
      Statues: Manual
      Types: Functional

.. note::
    The print command above uses the ``head`` command to show just one test
    case. Try without ``head`` command to see the entire output.

.. _summary_command:

summary command
+++++++++++++++

Gives a bird's-eye view of all the test cases in the given path.  The report
includes information such as:

  - total number of test cases.
  - number of test cases missing docstring.
  - usage of different tokens across the given project.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ testimony summary tests/

    Total number of tests:          7
    Test cases with no docstrings:  1 (14.29%)
    Assert:                         5 (71.43%)
    Bz:                             2 (28.57%)
    Feature:                        4 (57.14%)
    Setup:                          6 (85.71%)
    Status:                         3 (42.86%)
    Steps:                          6 (85.71%)
    Tags:                           4 (57.14%)
    Test:                           6 (85.71%)
    Type:                           1 (14.29%)


.. _validate_command:

validate command
++++++++++++++++

Validates all the test cases in the given path.  This helps ensure that all your
tests have the minimal set of tokens defined.  This command gives the required
information which will help you identify the issues pertaining to each
identified tests.

.. note::
    To make easier integration with CI tools like ``travis``, this command
    gives a non-zero return code when:

       - a test case is missing the docstring.
       - a test case is missing minimal set of tokens.
       - a test case has an unexpected token.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ testimony validate tests/

   tests/test_sample.py
